#### IL-12 Induced Regulation of the JAK-STAT Pathway in the Tumor Microenvironment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
* Date: June 2024 - February 2025
* **Abstract:** Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a prevalent cancer globally, accounting for one-third of all leukemia diagnoses and with only a 31.9% five-year survival rate. A significant factor within AML is the tumor microenvironment (TME), which engineers its surroundings to inhibit immune cells from accessing and suppressing the tumor. This is primarily the causative factor for the poor prognosis, symptoms, and treatment of cancer. Interleukin-12, an immune cytokine, is believed to promote the activity of IFN-γ and TNF-α, both of which are associated with heightened immune responses and apoptosis. Though IL-12 is hypothesized to be an anticancer drug, tumor studies have not found a significant influence, a concept this study attempts to address. Upon binding, IL-12 activates the JAK-STAT pathway, which ultimately upregulates STAT4, a transcription factor further stimulating Th1, IFN-γ, and TNF-α activity. This study assesses the strength of association between IL-12 and the JAK-STAT pathway in the context of the AML tumor microenvironment. Utilizing the UCSC Xena in-silico modeling analysis software, IL-12 was found to decrease VEGFA, a growth factor associated with the TME adaptability. However, IL-12 contradictorily down-regulated STAT4 and therefore limited IFN-γ and TNF-α development, indicating that JAK-STAT signaling was compromised. This may be attributed to inflammation induced by IL-12 as its increased CRP & IL-6 expression. Holistically, this study reveals the underlying biological mechanisms associated with IL-12 in AML, providing evidence that IL-12 can be a therapeutic treatment by decreasing inflammation and increasing JAK-STAT binding affinity, stagnating the tumor microenvironment and relieving the effects of AML.

#### Utilizing Differentiated Kinematic Sensors to Assess the Accuracy of a Robot in an Autonomous State
* Date: October 2023 - February 2024
* **Abstract:** As the field of automation, primarily kinematics, is increasing its prominence among automobiles and intelligent machines, this research paper conveys the influence of three primary kinematic sensor arrays: four wheel drive encoders, two wheel odometry and IMU Gyro, and three wheel odometry, on the accuracy of an autonomous robot to obtain its reference position. This was assessed through three primary kinematic procedures: a 360 rotational assessment, straight 152.4 cm line assessment, and a spline curve assessment, integrating both components into one primary nonlinear curvature trajectory resembling that of an “S” shape. These trajectories were pursued through two primary algorithms: feedforward projection and PID mitigation. In addition, calculating the alteration in position, or Pose, was determined through integrating differential equation models, referred to as Pose Exponentials. The data corresponded to the hypothesis, denoting the three-wheel odometry consisted of the greatest accuracy, followed by two wheel odometry and four drive encoders. This was primarily due to the ideals of traction and data reliance regarding the odometry wheels and its capability of pursuing these complex trajectories. Similarly, due to dead wheel documentation, the odometry modules consisted of the ability of course correct, indicating it retained its position regardless of external forces as a response to stimuli. Thus, this study has introduced significant insights in the field of control theory and kinematics and consists of a multitude of enhancements regarding AI and deep learning, external sensors, and algorithmic interfaces to advance automated kinematics within technological society.
