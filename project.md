### Utilizing Differentiated Kinematic Sensors to Assess the Accuracy of a Robot in an Autonomous State
* Date: June 2024 - December 2024
* **Abstract:** As the field of automation, primarily kinematics, is increasing its prominence among automobiles and intelligent
machines, this research paper conveys the influence of three primary kinematic sensor arrays: four wheel drive
encoders, two wheel odometry and IMU Gyro, and three wheel odometry, on the accuracy of an autonomous robot
to obtain its reference position. This was assessed through three primary kinematic procedures: a 360 rotational
assessment, straight 152.4 cm line assessment, and a spline curve assessment, integrating both components into one
primary nonlinear curvature trajectory resembling that of an “S” shape. These trajectories were pursued through
two primary algorithms: feedforward projection and PID mitigation. In addition, calculating the alteration in
position, or Pose, was determined through integrating differential equation models, referred to as Pose Exponentials.
The data corresponded to the hypothesis, denoting the three-wheel odometry consisted of the greatest accuracy,
followed by two wheel odometry and four drive encoders. This was primarily due to the ideals of traction and data
reliance regarding the odometry wheels and its capability of pursuing these complex trajectories. Similarly, due to
dead wheel documentation, the odometry modules consisted of the ability of course correct, indicating it retained
its position regardless of external forces as a response to stimuli. Thus, this study has introduced significant insights
in the field of control theory and kinematics and consists of a multitude of enhancements regarding AI and deep
learning, external sensors, and algorithmic interfaces to advance automated kinematics within technological society.
